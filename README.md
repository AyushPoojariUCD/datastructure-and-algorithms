# Datastructure-and-Algorithms

---

Just a coder sharpening my **data structures and algorithms** skills. This repo is my personal playground for learning, practicing, and implementing various DSA concepts.

Expect a mix of classic problems and my ongoing journey through fundamental computer science topics, primarily implemented in **C++**.

## What's Inside (Coming Soon!)

* Implementations of common data structures (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables)
* Solutions to popular algorithms (e.g., Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Recursion)
* My notes and thoughts as I tackle problems

## Getting Started

This repository is mainly for my own practice, but you're welcome to explore the code.

To run any specific implementation:

1.  Clone this repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/AyushPoojariUCD/datastructure-and-algorithms.git`
2.  Navigate to the specific folder for the data structure or algorithm you're interested in.
3.  Follow any specific instructions in that folder (e.g., compile and run a Java file, execute a Python script).

## Contribution

This is primarily a personal learning repository, so I'm not actively seeking external contributions right now. However, if you find an issue or have a suggestion, feel free to open an issue!

Happy coding!

# Datastructure-and-Algorithms

---

Just a coder sharpening my **data structures and algorithms** skills. This repo is my personal playground for learning, practicing, and implementing various DSA concepts.

Expect a mix of classic problems and my ongoing journey through fundamental computer science topics, primarily implemented in **C++**.

| Alias                                     | Meaning                         | Example                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `using ull = unsigned long long;`         | unsigned 64-bit                 | `ull big = 1ULL << 63;`           |
| `using pii = pair<int, int>;`             | shorthand for pair              | `pii p = {1, 2};`                 |
| `using vi = vector<int>;`                 | shorthand for vector<int>       | `vi arr = {1,2,3};`               |
| `using vll = vector<long long>;`          | shorthand for vector<long long> | `vll nums = {10,20,30};`          |
| `using pll = pair<long long, long long>;` | pair of long longs              | `pll p = {1000000, 2000000};`     |
| `using vvi = vector<vector<int>>;`        | 2D vector shorthand             | `vvi grid(3, vector<int>(3, 0));` |
